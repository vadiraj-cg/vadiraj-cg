Group health insurance plans dedicated to a group of people, working under one common platform. Buying group medical insurance requires a company to first focus on ensuring that employees do not have a financial shock due to hospitalisation. As with any product in the modern world, Insurance costs are a function of the type benefits and level of luxury you would like to afford for the treatment. Corporate Health Insurance and employee Insurance Scheme helps to boost employee retention, strengthen employee motivation, protect them from severe health conditions, and enhance their mental wellbeing. A group health mediclaim policy or a group health insurance plan has many benefits over an Individual Health Insurance policy. In group health insurance, only the employer has the right to cancel the policy. We at EDIFY strive to use an innovative approach to develop group health insurance policies, plans, and products that cut costs while maintaining superior coverage.
